# west-antarctic-ice-sheet-modelling
A notebook about modelling the WAIS, including model choice and Bayesian linear regression

GitHub can render iPython notebooks, so you can read this online. Unfortunately, it's not very good at LaTeX, so some of the equations come out aligned incorrectly, or with missing line breaks, or not processed at all. NBviewer is a little better, but to read it comfortably it's best to download and run it locally on a machine with LaTeX installed. Just use:

```
ipython notebook Linear-Regression.ipynb
```
